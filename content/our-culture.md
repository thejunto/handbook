## Guiding Principles

#### We started Junto Studio for two reasons:

1. **To create the future of learning.** To change traditional education. To use
technology to help learners pursue self-improvement at their own pace, on their
own time. In a collaborative, free, and encouraging environment.
2. **To create an environment where WE could learn.** Learn about technology,
entrepreneurship, design, and how to live a life of meaning. Learn with people
who challenge us, who encourage us, and who are willing to go to the end of the
universe with us.

#### We care deeply about:
- Integrity – #KeepingOurWord
- Mastery – Becoming very good at what we do
- Having a [Culture of Learning](#our-culture-of-learning)

#### We believe people can be self-governed.

This means you'll have a lot of freedom to choose what to work on, when to work
on it, and where to work from. This also means that you will have a lot of say
into what we will choose to work on as a company.

We strive for simplicity. Few job titles, few departments, few hierarchies. We
are builders and storytellers. We want to get better at what we love to do, work
hard, and strive for mastery.

This works well because:
- We have two clear reasons for why we exist (see above), and everyone at Junto
is on board with them.
- Everyone on the team is smart, driven, and talented.

how projects work, read our [Workflow](/content/workflow.md) section.

## Why We Need to Change Education

## Our Culture of Learning

We set out on this journey to learn. We believe that learning is a life-long
habit. We want to be the examples for others of how fun and different education
can be!

We believe learning is among the activities that bring the most fulfillment into
everyday life. If we learn about a particular topic for long enough, we'll
experience [Mastery](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560).
If we're learning something challenging enough, we'll experience [Flow](http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en).

These are some of the things we do to foster our Culture of Learning:
- Pay for online courses. Memberships to programs like Code School, Treehouse,
One Month and Upcase.
- Take online classes together or as a group.
- Allow for learning during 'work time'.
- Weekly Dialogue: Get together (in person or via Hangout) to talk about books,
articles, videos (anything really!) that we've found interesting.
- Talks: Anyone can give a presentation about an interesting topic (not
necessarily tech related). For example: personal finance, achieving happiness, etc.
- Guest Speakers: Invite someone external to one of our dialogues, or to give a 'talk'.
