## We believe in: 

- Asking the right questions. Clear communication.
- Trial and error.
- Measuring. What doesn't get measured doesn't get improved.

## Sales
At Junto, everyone is involved in Sales. The process looks like this:

1. Someone contacts us.
1. A card gets created and assigned to a team member (usually the Sales Guru) on Trello.
1. The assigned team member sends our Questionnaire (You can find it on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp) for the client to answer. 
1. The client fills out the Questionnaire.
1. We figure out who'll be involved.
1. The involved team Hangout/Skype with the client to understand the project better.
1. We discuss the project with the team. We figure out: 
		+ If we want to take it
		+ if we'll learn enough from doing it
		+ how much time it will take
		+ how much it'll cost
1. Send out a quote. (You can find the template on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
1. The client makes the downpayment (usually 50%).
1. We begin work.

This is what we look for in our clients and the projects we take:
- We can learn a lot from them.
- They understand and value highly the work we do and how we do it.
- We believe we can add a lot of value to their business.
- They can #KeepTheirWord and have high integrity.

We track our leads using the *Sales Funnel Board* in our Trello. 
1. A new lead comes in, either through the website, email or through personal relationships.
1. Whoever adds the card to Trello assigns it to Sales Guru in turn (currently Majo until the end of March), which in turn assigns it to a volunteer, if there is one. This is done by "putting the person's face" on it. 
1. This person is responsible for leading the client from the first interaction until we Skype/Hangout with them.

## How to manage a new project

Once the downpayment has been made, these are the steps to start a new project:

1. Create a new project on Basecamp.
1. Assign a project lead by writing his/her name on the description field in Basecamp.
1. Fill Out the Project Template when beginning a project.
1. Create a project channel on Slack.
1. Keep [Our Promises]()
1. A project is considered done when you’ve delivered Docked the Boat. (see “Docking the Boat”)

A project lead's main responsibility is to bring up the conversations necessary to move the project forward. He/She shouldn't demand things from other people involved in the project.

## Development

_pending_

In this section we'll talk about some development guidelines. I'll outline them here so I don't forget to include them later

* All external links should have `target: :_blank`
* Indent correctly. Follow the file's style. If the author indented with two spaces, so should you.
* In Ruby files, tabs = 2 spaces. In HTML ones you can choose the one you like best
* When creating a string column, always set the default string to "".
* Avoid inline comments. Put them in a separate line above the code.
