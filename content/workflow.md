# Workflow

At Junto we believe that everyone is capable of managing their own time, setting
their own priorities and keeping their word. We like being able to work from
anywhere in the world and still be able to deliver great work. (Living the dream!)
So how do we create the Junto culture and stay informed with everybody everywhere?

## How we set priorities:
Every Monday we set two priorities for the week during our [overlap](#overlaps).

1. **Work Priority**: What is the most important thing you will do
for the company this week?
This priority needs to be approved by everyone else on the team during the overlap.
  Examples:
  - Call 25 potential clients with the purpose of closing 20k in sales.
  - Send final invoice and thank-you card to our client with the purpose of closing the project.
  - Complete the Design Sprint with XYZ client with the purpose of giving a prototype to our dev team.
  - Have a first version of the website live to show to the client.
  - Present the Sales Plan for the upcoming month with the purpose of reaching X amount in sales next month.
2. **Learning Priority**: What will you learn this week?
Examples:
  - 30 min of Angular.js every day.
  - Complete two chapters of the Michael Hartl tutorial.
  - Read 25% of Alan Turing's biography.

Good goals are SMART:
- **S**pecific – What? Who? When? Where? Why?
- **M**easurable – How will I know when it is accomplished? What metrics will I use?
- **A**chievable –How realistic is the goal based on other constraints?
- **R**elevant - Does this seem worthwhile? Is this the right time? Does this match our other efforts/needs? Are you the right person?
- **T**ime-bound – When will this be done?


## Accountability
We [work remotely](/content/remote.md) part of the time, which means it's really
important to keep our work as transparent as possible so we can coordinate our
efforts.

There are two ways we keep each other accountable:

1. We keep our to-do's on a project management tool called [Basecamp](www.basecamp.com).
  With Basecamp, everyone knows who's in charge of what and when it's due. At the
  end of the day Basecamp automatically sends an email with a summary of what
  everyone accomplished for that day.
2. We use the #accountability channel on Slack to:
    - Check-in at the the start of our workday by saying what we will be working
     on that day. This is to help keep everybody in the loop of what you're
     working on and it allows us to coordinate efforts better. (We've found that
     using this channel has become invaluable.)
    - Check-out at the end of your workday (or periodically) by posting what
     you've accomplished and how the day went. We encourage posting work samples
      (e.g. documents, designs, commits) over just words.

## Consequences
You should check-in saying you accomplished your weekly **Work Priority** no later
than Saturday at 4am.
#### First fail:
If you fail to do so, on Monday at noon, everyone will stop what
they're working on and have a Skype call with you to discuss:
- Why you failed.
- What you can do next time to avoid the same mistakes.
- What valuable lessons can we all learn from this.
- What are the next steps for completing the failed task.

You will need to continue with the same priority for next week.

We see failure as an opportunity to learn. These meetings are positive, helpful, and fun.

#### Second fail in a row:
You will be asked to leave Junto. If it's unclear whether you failed or not,
the team will take a vote, majority wins.

## Working simultaneously:

When you walk into a traditional office, you expect to see other people
working. You might want to know how their day is going and ask for help if you
need it. Although everyone's working with different projects from their own
desks, it feels encouraging to know that your team is also pouring their efforts
on their work, and that they're just a couple of steps aways if you need them.

Now imagine the opposite: waking up looking forward for the projects you'll work
on during the day, and entering an empty, silent office.

![empty_office](/images/empty_office.jpg)

At Junto, we like to work in an atmosphere where you'll never feel like entering
an empty 'office'. And since we work remotely, we use Slack as our headquarters.
We value working simultaneously because we can keep ourselves accountable, ask
and give help, motivate each other, and work consistently every day. We bring
together the best of two worlds by working remotely, while doing it
simultaneously.

![full_office](/images/full_offices.jpg)

####How we work simultaneously:

Every day, we work at the same time during 4 hours. We have an #accountability
channel on Slack where we post our plan for the day during the first 10 minutes
of our 4-hour timeshare. After that, each one of us works on their own tasks.

Since we're all in Slack, we are expected to respond within 5 minutes.
'Being available' is the metric we use to make sure we're all together on the
same 'floor'. Because of this, we make sure to announce if we'll be away at some
moment.

####Schedule

8am -12pm (GMT-6:00) [Guatemala time]

####Consequences:

If we don't check-in during the first 10 minutes or have to leave early, we have
a 5% payroll deduction.

## Over-communicate

We over-communicate with clients to avoid having scheduled meetings. Every
problem arises from poor communication.

We over-communicate with our team to facilitate collaboration and coordination.
Good decisions are made when there's clear information.

We:

- Are online on Slack while we're working.
- Respond to emails within 24 hours.
- Keep our to-do's in Basecamp up-to-date.
- Keep track of our ideas in Trello.
- Use Google Calendar invites for all our meetings, hangouts, etc.

## From Idea to Action

This is the process an idea usually goes through:

1. Post the idea on the 'Everything' board in Trello, under the
'(name of project) Ideas' list.
2. Discuss the idea with the team over Slack.
3. If we chose to implement the idea, move it to the "Ideas We Decided to
Implement" list on the same Trello board.
4. When we decide who will be responsible for bringing the idea to life and when
 it should be done, move the idea to our Basecamp list on Trello and add it to the
 corresponding project on Basecamp. Don't forget to assign the to-do to the right
 person!
5. The Basecamp to-do gets completed and the idea goes live.

## Starting a Project
If you're thinking about doing something that might take longer than 2 weeks,
lots of people, or just has too many to-do's to keep in one Basecamp List, it
 might be a good time to start a project.

Projects are longer term, more complex objectives we put for ourselves. Things
 like doing a brand redesign, recording a marketing video or starting a new web
 product.

Same as with an idea, you should present it to the team, and once you have more
than just yourself on board with the project:
- Post it to our Projects To-do List in the Junto Studio project in Basecamp.
- Add these three things as a comment to the to-do:
  + Description
  + Objective
  + How will I measure success?

Quick note: Avoid leading more than 2 projects at a time.

## Overlaps

Overlaps are a big part of what makes Junto work, because this is the time when a
lot of decisions are made, and bottlenecks are sorted out. Everyone on the team
chats on Slack for about 30 minutes and each day of the week has
a theme.

- **Monday: Setting priorities (8:00AM)**
    + 8:00 to 8:15AM - Getting up to date. (Q&A about web dev, own products, blog)
    + 8:15 to 8:45AM - Set priorities for the week.
- **Tuesday: Workflow (10:30AM)**
    + Talk about our work processes at a metacognitive level.
    What can we improve? What would make us more productive? Happier?
    + Propose new Pull Requests.
    + Address open Pull Requests (if any).
- **Wednesday: Growth (12:30PM)**
    + Define monthly goals in line with medium term goals.
    + Check-in with overall progress of monthly goals.
    + Address growth concerns. What is blocking you from doing your best work?
    + How is your learning experience going?
- **Thursday: Feedback (10:30AM)**
    + How did you feel throughout the week?
    + What went well? What could be improved upon?
    + Is there anything you would like to get off your chest?
