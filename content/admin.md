## Administration

#### Payments
Payments are made the last friday of the month. If a payday falls on a
nonworking day, we'll use the preceding workday.

#### Expenses
Expenses under $50USD don't need prior approval. Reimbursements will be made
only upon receipt (digital or physical). Use your best judgement on how much
to spend and what is a business expense.

#### Vacation / Time-Off
We don't have a vacation policy. You are free to take as much time-off as you
want whenever you want. We only ask that you let the people you're working with
know that you're leaving two weeks in advance. If you have any critical tasks,
that you complete them before you take-off. If these conditions are not met,
time-off will not be remunerated.

## Policies

#### Intellectual Property

All software, concepts, development and completed projects are the property of
the company or our clients.

None of it should be used for personal projects or personal gain, unless a
previous agreement has been reached.

Our agreements are based on trust. It's important that we're all very
conscious with where and how we share projects we've worked on, since we're not
looking to enforce this with further consequences.
