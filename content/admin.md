# Administration

## Payments
Payments are made the last friday of the month. If a payday falls on a
nonworking day, we'll use the preceding workday.

## Expenses
Expenses under $50USD don't need prior approval. Reimbursements will be made
only upon receipt (digital or physical). Use your best judgement on how much
to spend and what is a business expense.

## Vacation / Time-Off
We don't have a vacation policy. You are free to take as much time-off as you
want whenever you want. We only ask that you let the people you're working with
know that you're leaving two weeks in advance. If you have any critical tasks,
that you complete them before you take-off. If these conditions are not met,
time-off will not be remunerated.
