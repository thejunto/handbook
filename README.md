Hey Pear,

Welcome Aboard the Junto boat! We couldn’t be more excited to have you as a peer!
Or as we like to call each other, a pear. We’re thrilled to see what adventures
we’ll embark on together, what discoveries we make, and most importantly how we
support each other in becoming the people we want to be. :)

As we set out on this journey we wanted to give you a “lay of the land”. Share
with you where we’re at, where we’ve been, and practical info you might need to
set sail.

As you read this document keep in mind that it’s based on the journey we’ve
covered so far and what we’ve learned. We hope that you evolve, improve it and
take it to the next level!

Happy sailing!
